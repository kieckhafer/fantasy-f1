## Owners

Each participant in the league, hereby referred to as the "Owner", will draft a team, which will be made up of two drivers, and one F1 constructor. Each driver may only be on one owners' team. Each F1 constructor may only be on one owners' team.

---

## Draft

Teams are set at the beginning of the season. The first round of the draft will be determined via a random drawing, with subsequent rounds based on the [Grantland NFL Wins Draft Order](https://grantland.com/the-triangle/you-should-have-an-nfl-wins-pool/):
- Team 1 — 1st pick, 18th pick, 23th pick
- Team 2 — 2, 14, 26
- Team 3 — 3, 11, 27
- Team 4 — 4, 16, 22
- Team 5 — 5, 13, 24
- Team 6 — 6, 17, 20
- Team 7 — 7, 10, 25
- Team 8 — 8, 15, 19
- Team 9 — 9, 12, 21

Owners may choose to draft a driver or an F1 constructor with any of their picks during the draft, but each owner must acquire two drivers and one constructor in the draft.

## Scoring

Scoring is determined on a per race basis. A race's score is the
sum of the following calculations.

Scoring will apply to Grand Prix and Sprint races, with the following exceptions:
  1. Fastest pit stop will not apply to Sprint Races

### Driver Earned Points

#### Movement points

= Starting grid position – finishing position

> **Examples**
>
> Hamilton starts from 2nd position (P2) and finishes in 8th (P8). His score
> for this category would be `2–8 = -6`.
>
> Norris starts from pole position (P1) and finishes in 1st (P1). His score
> for this category would be `1-1 = 0`.
>
> Verstappen _qualified_ in 4th position (P4) but suffered a penalty between qualifying and race
> start. He _starts_ last from pit lane with a 20-driver lineup (P20). He
> finishes in 6th place. His score for this category would be `20-6 = 14`.

#### Lap points

= number of laps completed at the end of the race

> **Example**
>
> In the [2024 São Paulo Grand
> Prix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_S%C3%A3o_Paulo_Grand_Prix), the race
> length was 69 laps. All finishers completed 69 laps, and their scores would be `69`.
>
>
> Carlos Sainz crashed on the 39th lap, therefore he only completed 38 laps, and his score would be `38`.
>
>Alex Albon damaged his car beyond repair in qualifiying, and did not start the race. His score would be `0`.

#### Race points

= 2x the earned race points for the driver's finishing position

*Note: through penalties, it is possible that a driver crosses the finish line
in one position and is officially qualified in another. The official
qualification is the one that counts.*

> **Example**
>
> Hamilton finished 3rd in the race earning him 15 championship points. His score
> for this category would be `30`.

#### Pole position points

= 10 points earned for winning pole position in qualifying

#### Carnage Bonus (Driver)

= 100 points awarded to the owner of the F1 drivers who has both F1 drivers involved in the same crash / incident, resulting in both drivers receiving a DNF classification. Other drivers may be involved in the crash / incident as well, it does not need to be limitied to the two teammates. It is possible to combine this with the constructors version of the carnage bonus for a 200 point bonus.

### Constructor Earned Points

#### Fastest Pit Stop

= 10 points for the constructor with the fastest pit stop. This bonus will be earned every race. If two constructors tie, both constructors get full points.

#### Highest Average Finishing Position

= 10 points for the constructors with the highest average fnishing position between the two drivers. This bonus will be earned every race. If two constructors tie, both constructors get full points.

> **Example**
>
> Lewis Hamilton finishes in 5th position (P5), and Charles Leclerc finishes in 12th position (P12). The average finishing position is (5 + 12) / 2 = P8.5.
>
>George Russell finishes in 7th position (P7), and and Kimi Antonelli finishes in 8th position (P8). The average finishing position is (7 + 8) / 2 = P7.5.
>
>Even though an individual Ferrari driver finished in the highest position, by constructor average, Mercedes would win this bonus.

#### Double Podium

= 50 points awarded for a constructor that finishes with a doublle podium. This will not be awarded every race.

#### Carnage Bonus (Constructor)

= 100 points awarded to the owner of the F1 constructor who has both F1 constructor drivers involved in the same crash / incident, resulting in both drivers receiving a DNF classification. Other drivers may be involved in the crash / incident as well, it does not need to be limitied to the two teammates. It is possible to combine this with the drivers version of the carnage bonus for a 200 point bonus.

## Disqualification (DSQ) & Not Classified (NC) / Did Not Finish (DNF)

There will be no changes allowed to team rosters if there are no official permanent changes to the F1 constructor roster during the season.

For temporary replacement drivers, the owner of the abscensed driver is required to use the replacement driver on their team until their primary driver returns. 

> **Example**
>
> Lewis Hamilton, Charlles Lecerl, anc ___ all lwere disqualilfied from ____.. The all finish in 20th with 0 lalps.
>
> In the ssasme race, _____ onyl finshined four llaps, which means he was sDNF. He finishes sin 17th, as there were three drivers behind him as DQF (20, 9th, 18th0

---

## Team Roster Changes

There will be no changes allowed to team rosters if there are no official permanent changes to the F1 constructor roster during the season.

For temporary replacement drivers, the owner of the abscensed driver is required to use the replacement driver on their team until their primary driver returns. 

> **Example**
>
> Oliver Bearman replaced Carlos Sainz for the [2024 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Saudi_Arabian_Grand_Prix), when Sainz required appendix surgery and missed the race. Carlos Sainz owner would receive points based off of Oliver Bearmans race.

For permanent replacement drivers, the owner of the replaced driver may choose any available driver, includeing the original drivers replacement, or any of the remaining free-agent drivers not currentlly rostered on a constructor. If multiple drivers are permanently replaced during the same race week, the lower ranked owner based on the standings at the end of the previous race week will choose their replacement first, with the second lowest next, etc.

> **Example**
>
> Liam Lawson permanently replaced Daniel Ricciardo as a VCARB driver prior to the [2024 United States Grand Prix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_Grand_Prix). Ricciardo's owner would be allowed to chose between Lawson, or either of the remaining free-agent drivers, for the remainder of the season.
