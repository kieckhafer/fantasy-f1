## Teams

Each participant in the league, hereby referred to as the "Owner", will draft a team, which will be made up of two drivers, and one F1 team. Each driver may only be on one
owners' team. Each F1 team may only be on one owners' team.

## Draft

Teams are set at the beginning of the season. The first round of the draft will be determined via a random drawing, with subsequent rounds based on the [Grantland NFL Wins Draft Order](https://grantland.com/the-triangle/you-should-have-an-nfl-wins-pool/):
- Team 1 — 1st pick, 20th pick, 26th pick
- Team 2 — 2, 16, 29
- Team 3 — 3, 13, 30
- Team 4 — 4, 18, 25
- Team 5 — 5, 15, 27
- Team 6 — 6, 19, 22
- Team 7 — 7, 11, 28
- Team 8 — 8, 17, 21
- Team 9 — 9, 14, 23
- Team 10 — 10, 12, 24

Owners may choose to draft a driver or an F1 team with any of their picks during the draft, but each owner must acquire two drivers and one team in the draft.

## Scoring

Scoring is determined on a per race basis. A race's score is the
sum of the following calculations.

Scoring will apply to Grand Prix and Sprint races, with the following exceptions:
  1. Fastest pit stop will not apply to Sprint Races

### Driver Earned Points

#### Movement points

= Starting grid position – finishing position

> **Examples**
>
> Hamilton starts from 2nd position (P2) and finishes in 8th (P8). His score
> for this category would be `2–8 = -6`.
>
> Norris starts from pole position (P1) and finishes in 1st (P1). His score
> for this category would be `1-1 = 0`.
>
> Verstappen _qualified_ in 4th position (P4) but suffered a penalty between qualifying and race
> start. He _starts_ last from pit lane with a 20-driver lineup (P20). He
> finishes in 6th place. His score for this category would be `20-6 = 14`.

#### Lap points

= number of laps completed at the end of the race

> **Example**
>
> In the [2024 São Paulo Grand
> Prix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_S%C3%A3o_Paulo_Grand_Prix), the race
> length was 69 laps. All finishers completed 69 laps, and their scores would be `69`.
>
>
> Carlos Sainz crashed on the 39th lap, therefore he only completed 38 laps, and his score would be `38`.
>
>Alex Albon damaged his car beyond repain in qualifiying, and did not start the race. His score would be `0`.

#### Race points

= 2x the earned race points for the driver's finishing position

*Note: through penalties, it is possible that a driver crosses the finish line
in one position and is officially qualified in another. The official
qualification is the one that counts.*

> **Example**
>
> Hamilton finished 3rd in the race earning him 15 championship points. His score
> for this category would be `30`.

#### Pole position points

= 10 points earned for winning pole position in qualifying

### Team Earned Points

#### Fastest Pit Stop

= 10 points for the team with the fastest pit stop. This bonus will be earned every race. If two teams tie, both teams get full points.

#### Highest Average Finishing Position

= 10 points for the team with the highest average fnishing position between the two drivers. This bonus will be earned every race. If two teams tie, both teams get full points.

> **Example**
>
> Lewis Hamilton finishes in 5th position (P5), and Charles Leclerc finishes in 12th position (P12). The average finishing position is (5 + 12) / 2 = P8.5.
>
>George Russell finishes in 7th position (P7), and and Kimi Antonelli finishes in 8th position (P8). The average finishing position is (7 + 8) / 2 = P7.5.
>
>Even though an individual Ferrari driver finished in the highest position, by team average, Mercedes wouuld win this bonus.

#### Double Podium

= 50 points awarded for a team that finishes with a doublle podium. This will not be awarded every race.

## Team Roster Changes

There will be no changes allowed to team rosters if there are no official permanent changes to the F1 team roster during the season.

For temporary replacement drivers, the owner of the abscensed driver is required to use the replacement driver on their team until their primary driver returns. 

> **Example**
>
> Oliver Bearman replaced Carlos Sainz for the [2024 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Saudi_Arabian_Grand_Prix), when Sainz required appendix surgery and misssed the race. Carlos Sainz owner would receive points based off of Oliver Bearmans race.

For permanent replacement drivers, the owner of the replaced driver may choose any available driver, includeing the original drivers replacement, or any of the remaining free-agent drivers not currentlly rostered on a team.

> **Example**
>
> Liam Lawson permanently replaced Daniel Ricciardo as a VCARB driver prior to the [2024 United States Grand Prix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_Grand_Prix). Ricciardo's owner would be allowed to chose between Lawson, or either of the remaining free-agent drivers, for the remainder of the season.
